BZtraps
=======

simple work-in-progress Magma plugin.

Allows users to set a trap on a door (eventually other object) that will slow or injure other players when they try to access a private object or area.

I'll add some more info here as I get work done on it.

This is extracted from the BZcore plugin and may or may not contain all the features available there.
